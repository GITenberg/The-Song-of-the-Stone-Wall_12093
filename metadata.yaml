description: Blind, deaf and unable to communicate from a young age, Helen Keller
  was eventually taught to read, write and speak with the help of an extraordinary
  teacher. This lead to a flowering of creativity and imagination in Keller, who went
  on to produce dozens of memoirs, essays, letters, and stories. The Song of the Stone
  Wall is a book-length poem that details Keller's participation in the construction
  of a wall on the grounds of her home that made it possible for her to roam farther
  safely.
